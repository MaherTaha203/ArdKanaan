## 1. Purpose

Permanent, measurable dashboard of repository health. It is refreshed **after every
completed phase** (GOV-005 §1 step 8, AI-38) using the mechanical checks of AI-37,
and its values must agree with the latest audit report. A dashboard value that
cannot be backed by evidence is a Gate 6 DEFECT.

## 2. Dashboard

**Last refresh:** 2026-07-16 — Phase 0 extension close (AUD-P0-002)

| # | Indicator | Value | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Documentation completeness (registered docs present / planned for open phases) | 24 / 24 | 100% | 🟢 |
| 2 | Architecture consistency (structure matches IDX-001 §1; phase boundaries intact) | conformant | conformant | 🟢 |
| 3 | Business consistency (facts F-01…F-09 uncontradicted across repo) | 0 contradictions | 0 | 🟢 |
| 4 | UX consistency (no rule violating M-07/F-08) | 0 violations | 0 | 🟢 |
| 5 | Design consistency (canonical headers / document design) | 24 / 24 docs conformant | 100% | 🟢 |
| 6 | Terminology consistency (banned-synonym occurrences outside defining rules) | 0 | 0 | 🟢 |
| 7 | Traceability coverage (atoms with required upstream citations) | 9 / 9 F-atoms cite M-atoms | 100% | 🟢 |
| 8 | Broken references (relative links that fail to resolve) | 0 | 0 | 🟢 |
| 9 | Technical debt (accepted deviations awaiting repair) | 0 items | 0 | 🟢 |
| 10 | Open decisions (ADRs in PROPOSED state) | 0 | 0 | 🟢 |
| 11 | Frozen documents | 10 (GOV-000…GOV-007, AUD-P0-001, AUD-P0-002) + 6 ACCEPTED ADRs | n/a | 🟢 |
| 12 | Pending reviews (phases open, awaiting gates) | 0 — no phase open | 0 at close | 🟢 |

Status legend: 🟢 at target · 🟡 deviation, repair scheduled · 🔴 deviation blocking
next phase.

## 3. Measurement rules

1. Indicators 1, 5, 8 are computed mechanically (register diff, header check, link
   scan); 2–4, 6–7 combine mechanical scans with the corresponding gate's review;
   9–12 are read from DEC-000, IDX-001, and RDM-001.
2. Any 🔴 indicator blocks opening the next phase until repaired and re-audited.
3. Each refresh cites the audit report that supplies its evidence.
